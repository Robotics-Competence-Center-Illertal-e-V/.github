# Robotics Competence Center Illertal e.V.

The abbreviation RoCCI stands for Robotics Competence Center Illertal. We are a registered non-profit association whose aim is to get young people interested in robotics and technology and to promote the teaching of scientific and engineering skills. To achieve this goal, we offer various courses for students from all types of schools. We also take part in numerous robotics competitions and RoboCups to demonstrate our skills.

Through our activities, we help children, young people and trainees to overcome their fear of contact with modern technology and at the same time provide them with important guidance for their future career choices. We cooperate with national and international schools, universities and commercial enterprises in order to be able to offer a modern education at the cutting edge of technology.
